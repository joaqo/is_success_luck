# Veritasium: Is Success Luck or Hard Work?

In this [great Veritasium video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3LopI4YeC4I) the question in the title is posed. From it I started wondering if intelligence's rarity influenced luck's influence. So I tried to reproduce the expermient mentioned in the video, and see if I could test this.

Please feel free to contact me if you find think that anything is wrong with the way I'm thinking about this!
